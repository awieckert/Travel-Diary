# TRAVEL DIARY YAY!

# Description
This group exercise was meant to challenge our understanding of event listeners and DOM traversal. We were to create a Travel Diary page that allowed the user to blog about their favorite travel locations. The user should be able to identify location he or she had previously blogged about. Additionally the user should be able to edit blog posts.

Utilization of functions calling other functions was key to this exercise.
